# Vertex AI: Predicting Loan Risk with AutoML

- Credits: Google Skill Boost
- Introduction to AI and Machine Learning on Google Cloud

## Objective

- Use AutoMl to predict loan risk through building a Ml model
- The dataset is related to loans from financial institution with 2.500 data points (AutoML requires at least 100 data points)
- Practice the learning of the course about ML workflow:
   1. Data Preparation
   2. Model Development
   3. Model Serving
- Evaluate the model performance.
- Deploy the model to an endpoint.
- Get predictions.
