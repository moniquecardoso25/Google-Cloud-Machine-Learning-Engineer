## 2. [Predicting Visitor Purchases with BigQuery ML](https://github.com/moniquecardoso25/Google-Cloud-Machine-Learning-Engineer/tree/92d2ad642f93c17c73e499681c7872bfffa7719e/Predicting%20Visitor%20Purchases%20with%20BigQuery%20ML)

Description: Your data analyst team exported the Google Analytics logs for an ecommerce website into BigQuery and created a new table of all the raw ecommerce visitor session data for you to explore. Using this data, you'll try to answer a few questions.

Tools used: BigQueryML, SQL

- Query and explore the ecommerce dataset
- Create a training and evaluation dataset to be used for batch prediction
- Create a classification (logistic regression) model in BigQuery ML
- Evaluate the performance of your machine learning model
- Predict and rank the probability that a visitor will make a purchase

## 3. [Entity and Sentiment Analysis with the Natural Language API](https://github.com/moniquecardoso25/Google-Cloud-Machine-Learning-Engineer/tree/a9ad6e8ff1b91a4c97a29668f3c6fc9070e20086/Entity%20and%20Sentiment%20Analysis%20with%20the%20Natural%20Language%20API)

Description: The Cloud Natural Language API lets extract entities from text, perform sentiment and syntactic analysis, and classify text into categories.
Learn how to use the Natural Language API to analyze entities, sentiment, and syntax by:

- Creating a Natural Language API request and calling the API with curl
- Extracting entities and running sentiment analysis on text with the Natural Language API
- Performing linguistic analysis on text with the Natural Language API
- Creating a Natural Language API request in a different language

Tool used:
- API KEY
- SHH (from Compute Engine Instance)
- Natural Language API
   - Multilingual natural language processing
   - Analyzing syntax and parts of speech
   - Analyzing entity sentiment
   - Sentiment analysis with the Natural Language API
